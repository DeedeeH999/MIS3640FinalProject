# Project Proposal for final project for MIS3640

### The Big idea
#### What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?

Our goal in this project is to help Airbnb hosts in New York City predict how much they should charge customers based on neighborhood, type of room, reviews, ratings, and other metrics using Python to create a prediction model. 

At the minimum, we can create a prediction model using different Python modules and statements. We hope to create a variety of functions that will clean the data, run basic analytic formulas (average, median, linear relationships, etc), and then give a result of estimated prices based on the data used.

Our stretch goal is to create an interactive map of New York City with this data displayed in Python. This map will have the average price range per neighborhoods in New York city, mimicking a map of realtor house prices.
